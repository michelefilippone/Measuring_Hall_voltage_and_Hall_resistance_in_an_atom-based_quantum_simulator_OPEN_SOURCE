This repository includes a Jupiter notebook to generate all the numerical results presented in "Measuring Hall voltage and Hall resistance in an atom-based quantum simulator" ny T.-W. Zhou et al. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09744) 

This repository includes the experimental data in the folder "EXP_DATA" and the theoretical atom disrtibution in the different one-dimensional tubes in the folde "Atom_distributions"

The interested user is supposed to create a folder named "data" where all intermediate dataset need to be saved and
